Total stars: 10*

## Day 15
Managed to bag a star in the suspiciously easy part 1. I seem to be 
missing something in the comprehension for part 2, since it works for the 
sample input, but not on the actual input

## Day 10
Well I'm not good enough to write a path-finding algorithm (yet) 

## Day 9
A good solid for day 9. Glad part 2 was only a slight refactor since I 
was expecting something way worse. Not complaining though, I'll take the
double star

## Day 8
Spent about 2 hours trying to get my code to run in the first place, doesn't work.

## Day 7
Figured out the first part of the problem, sorting the hands based on type of hand,
but couldn't figure out how to sort within each hand.

## Day 6
Easiest one in a bit. Just took a while to comprehend 
the question. Got part one with pen and paper, and then
later wrote the code for it. Runtime for part 2 was
~10s because of brute force, but if it works it works ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Day 5
Hardest one so far. Absolutely no ideas here.

## Day 4
Part I took a good while, and couldn't figure out
how to write a recursive function to do part 2.

## Day 3
Had my eureka moment where I figured how to read cells 
adjacent to a certain cell, but couldn't figure out how to 
expand that to read the entire number after that.

## Day 2
Really happy to just have solved this at least. Didn't bother
to read the question properly and spent 30 minutes 
trying to debug a solution that was inherently wrong in the 
first place. Just happy to take the stars in the end.

## Day 1
Didn't go too well considering the big hopes and dreams of 
the 'leaderboard', I'm missing an edge case on P2, and 
choked out of nervousness in P1. In retrospect, achieving a
position on the leaderboard for P1 appears achievable
with better execution. 

Day 9 update: Finished Part 2 finally. An absolute bodge
of a solution, but it taught me how to break twice inside a 
nested for loop
